# CM4 OS installation and configuration

These instructions are for the Raspberry Pi OS Lite. Raspberry Pi OS used to be called Raspbian.

As of the time of writing (early 2024), the current version of Raspberry Pi OS is based on Debian 12 (Bookworm).
The legacy version of Raspberry Pi OS is based on Debian 11 (Bullseye).
We are using Raspberry Pi OS, since it is optimized for the Raspberry Pi hardware.
We are using the Lite version, since we do not need or want a desktop environment for this application. We are also using the 64-bit version, since this takes best advantage of the CM4 hardware (particularly with 8Gb RAM).

## OS installation

~Install Raspberry Pi OS Lite 64-bit.~

If your CM4 has eMMC, follow these [instructions](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/compute-module.html#flashing-the-compute-module-emmc).
When using the Raspberry Pi Imager, select ~`Raspberry Pi OS (other)` and then  `Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)`~.

TODO: installation without eMMC

TODO: What is the minimum amount of RAM for 64-bit to be a better choice than 32-bit? Not sure if 1Gb RAM would work better with a 32-bit OS. 

DOING: installation with MATE for ROS1 access
 
1. flash (via eMMC) the **Ubuntu Server 20.04.6** image in the rpi installer menu.
2. after server installation `sudo apt-get install mate-desktop-full` with lightweight gui option (non-default)
3. look at the `mate-ros1` branch of this repo


## OS configuration

If you want to do this using SSH from your main machine, then

* run `raspi-config` to enable SSH (under Interfacing)
* find the current IP address using `ifconfig`

Update packages

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

Run `raspi-config`:

* enable serial port (under Interface/Serial Port); answer
   * No to login shell accessible over serial
   * Yes to enable serial port hardware

Configure the Device Tree for the CM4 and the IO board by adding the following
at the end of `/boot/firmware/config.txt` (on Raspberry Pi OS 11, it's `/boot/config.txt`).

```
# Enable GPIO pin 18 for PPS (not always necessary, but useful for testing)
dtoverlay=pps-gpio,gpiopin=18
# realtime clock
dtoverlay=i2c-rtc,pcf85063a,i2c_csi_dsi
# fan
dtoverlay=i2c-fan,emc2301,i2c_csi_dsi
# Make /dev/ttyAMA0 be connected to GPIO header pins 8 and 10
# This always disables Bluetooth
dtoverlay=disable-bt
```

Disable the system service that initialises the modem:
```
sudo systemctl disable hciuart
```

Set the timezone:

```
sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
```

Use raspi-config to set
* wifi country (under System Options > Wireless LAN)
* hostname (under System Options)

Reboot.

## Static IP address

Although it's not essential, you probably want a static IP address.

### Network Manager

Raspberry Pi OS 12 by default uses Network Manager to manage network connections.

You can see the current connections using

```
nmcli con show
```

Assuming the connection on the interface is named `Wired connection 1`, you can change it to a static IP using a command like:

```
nmcli con mod "Wired connection 1" ipv4.method manual ipv4.addresses 192.168.0.5/24 ipv4.gateway 192.168.0.1 \
   ipv4.dns 8.8.8.8 ipv4.dns-search lan
```

You can activate this by doing:

```
nmcli con down "Wired connection 1"
nmcli con up "Wired connection 1"
```

### dhcpcd

Raspberry Pi OS 11 by default uses dhcpcd to manage the network. Edit the section of `/etc/dhcpcd.conf` starting with `Example static IP configuration`.

## Verify OS setup

Check that your kernel includes the necessary have ethernet PTP hardware support

```
ethtool -T eth0
```

You should see:

```
Time stamping parameters for eth0:
Capabilities:
        hardware-transmit
        hardware-receive
        hardware-raw-clock
PTP Hardware Clock: 0
Hardware Transmit Timestamp Modes:
        off
        on
        onestep-sync
        onestep-p2p
Hardware Receive Filter Modes:
        none
        ptpv2-event
```

Note that `PTP Hardware Clock: 0` means that this interface uses `/dev/ptp0` as
its hardware clock.

Check the RTC

```
sudo hwclock --show
```

Check that the current date is correct:

```
date
```

Check support for the fan controller. Do

```
ls /sys/class/thermal
```

You should see:

```
cooling_device0  thermal_zone0
```

## Verify GPS connection

You should verify that the GPS is properly connected. There are two connections

- the serial connection
- the PPS connection

### Serial connection

Assuming you have specified `dtoverlay=disable-bt` above and you have connected the GPS
RX (white) and TX (green) pins to pins 8 and 10 respectively on the J8 HAT connector,
then the serial device will be `/dev/ttyAMA0`.

Do:

```
(stty 9600 -echo -icrnl; cat) </dev/ttyAMA0
```

Here 9600 is the speed. The most common default speed is 9600, but some receivers default to 38400 or 115200.

You should see  lines starting with `$`.
In particular look for a line starting with `$GPRMC` or `$GNRMC`. The number following that should be the current UTC time;
for example, `025713.00` means `02:57:13.00` UTC.
After another 8 commas, there will be a field that should have the current UTC date;
for example, `140923` means 14th Septemember 2023.

### PPS connection

To verify that the PPS connection is working, first configure the SYNC_OUT for input: 

```
echo 1 0 | sudo tee /sys/class/ptp/ptp0/pins/SYNC_OUT
```

Replace the `0` in `ptp0` with whatever `ethtool` said was the number.
`SYNC_OUT` here is the name of the pin to which the PPS is connected. In the `echo 1 0`, 1 means to use the pin for input and 0 means the pin should use input channel 0.


Now do:
```
echo 0 1 | sudo tee /sys/class/ptp/ptp0/extts_enable
```

This means to enable timestamping of pulses on channel 0. In the `echo 0 1`, 0 means channel 0 and 1 means to enable timestamping.


Now see if we're getting timestamps:

```
sudo cat /sys/class/ptp/ptp0/fifo
```

The `cat` command should output a line, which represents a timestamp of an input pulse and consists of 3 numbers: channel number, which is zero in this case, seconds count, nanoseconds count. Repeating the last command will give lines for successive input timestamps.

If `cat` outputs nothing, then it's not working.
